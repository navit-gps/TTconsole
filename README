Name        : TTconsole                    
Version     : 1.14                              Vendor: Markus Hoffmann
Group       : Embedded/Shell                    License: GPL

Summary     : A Text console for the TomTom ONE car navigation system
Description :

The text screen has a size of 64x30 charackters (on the TomTom ONE) if the
keyboard is invisible and 64x25 if the virtual keyboard is shown on the
console. Al though you can hide the keyboard you can still use it (if you
remember where the key are). Also you can cut an paste text regions from the
screen to the input.

It appears that the builtin shell is busybox. There is no editor (like pico or
nano) installed (except for vi of course) but you can put the pico excecutable
on the INTERNAL directory which appears at /mnt/sdcard/.

Excecution of shell scripts works well and I am currently working on an
arm-linux-version of X11-Basic (textmode only already is available, but the
graphics commands need to be adapted.) 

 * TTconsole is free software and comes with NO WARRANTY - read the file
 * COPYING for details

The Software is not tested on other devices than TomTom ONE V3, 
but it might work.


The framebuffer rendering and Touchscreen routines are based on 
the Hello World Example which was published (GPL) by TomTom.

Some procedures are taken from the X11Basic package.
