do a 

make depend
make
make bindist

The result will be 
TTconsole-1.00-bin.zip 
which is the binary package. The contents of this zip file can be 
directly copied to the TomTom.

===Install the binary package on the TomTom===

Unpack the binary package (zip file) and move the contents to your tomtom
Directory (e.g. /media/INTERNAL) just as they are. Thats it. It is not
necessary to rebuild the systems kernel. You do not need opentomlinux! You can
use the device with navigation software as before. The icon for TTconsole
should appear in the setting menu.
